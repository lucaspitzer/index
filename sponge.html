Why does SB refer to his nametag as his 'identity'? And indeed, what does it <i>mean</i> to identify oneself? To answer this question we must revisit the Lacanian mirror stage. <br/><br/>

Before the ego is formed, we and the world are one and the same. There is this sense of harmony with nature that apparently a lot of us end up striving to return to.<br/><br/>

The key point is SB seems to define himself by his profession. This is not a controversial point. We remind ourselves of the japanese quadgram of harmony, and criticize it.
