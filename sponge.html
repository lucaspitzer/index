1. "Missing identity" [draft 1]<br/></font>
<font face = "Courier" size = "3" color = "#65eb34">
Why does SB refer to his nametag as his 'identity'? And indeed, what does it <i>mean</i> to identify oneself? To answer this question we must revisit the Lacanian mirror stage. <br/><br/>

Before the ego is formed, we and the world are one and the same. There is this sense of harmony with nature that apparently a lot of us end up striving to return to. We suddenly approach a singularity, where we are confronted by our own image. We realise that we are separate to the environment we live in; we are forever aliented from the very structure we from then on live in. SB solves this problem by fiercely identifying himself with this <i>specular image</i>; insisting that he and who Others perceive him be are but one and the same.<br/><br/>

The key point is SB seems to define himself by his profession. This is fine and dandy when the movement of symbols is predictable and comprehensible. But the ruling language cannot tolerate a <i>hole</i> where the self used to be! If I can't name myself, who am I? Likewise, if I do not have a name, might I just as well be anyone? Suddenly all sense of agency; belonging and yes, identity is in jeopardy. <br/><br/>

Let us analyse how SB attempts to deal with the situation. After a phase of <i>panic</i> he attempts the only true pragmatic solution: to retrace his steps exactly, to such details as eating snail food and falling down the stairs. But <i>can you step in the same river twice?</i> Well, perhaps. We should not be too quick to criticise SB's methodology. Recall that eventually the name tag ends up being found on his back (he is wearing his shirt backwards). In a sense, his identity was <i>always right on him</i>! It just had to be found!<br/><br/>

Does this not sound familiar? We live in a world where a lot of us devote lots of time trying to uncover who we are. There's various schools of thought on this depending on if you're religious, existentialist, nihilist etc. Does existence precede essence? If so, well, SB's victory becomes rather Pyrrhic. <br/><br/>
