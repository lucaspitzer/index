Music doesn't matter. You don't have to play another note of music. This is, perhaps, what gives music its meaning; its soul, its life. I am doing this because I want to, and only because I want to. This is a point worth meditating on. Without needing to play music, you are free. Playing music without the need to play music makes it an exercise in love.<br/><br/>
But we <i>need</i> our loved ones, don't we? Without them, how could we possibly live? And yet we apparently argue that <i>needing</i> to do something reduces the action of the domain of love. We argue that we could so do without music, it is so useless to us that we can approach it with open arms; away from any semblance of dependence. Is this not irresponsible parenting at worst? When applied to your children, perhaps so. Maybe because we have a morally mandated responsibility to care for them. But music is not like that. Music would get on just fine without you! The will be scores of visionaries in each generation, at least before the apocalypse strikes. You will not be missed. And yet this is the thing you choose to kindle, even if you may lose it any day? If one day it vanishes, will it have all been for nought? <br/><br/>Well, not if you have allowed it to fully influence your self in a positive way. Not if it was used as a vehicle to build upon the self. Now that can't be taken away... can it? Oh, don't get me started on food.

I hate that I am too tired to practise and must go to bed. There is no point in practising if I am not in the right mindset. There is no achieving anything tangible -- no -- transcendent if you are not in the right mindset to operate on it. Well of course the nature of transcendent things is nobody understands the process. If they did it would be banal. No one understands. That is the price we -- no -- I pay. I will not be defeated. I will not be defeated. But we can't win a battle on an empty stomach, and we can't win a battle on inadequate sleep. So sleep we will. Ow my hand hurts. Fuck's sake.

You're all so idiotic. Nothing matters. You're all gonna be forgotten in like a couple billion years or so like. Just be compassionate and then fuck off to wherever you're going next. [Please note: for concerned readers let me remind you the METAPHORICAL nature of these texts. Gawd idiots.]
