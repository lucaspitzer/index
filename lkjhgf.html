1. [draft 1]<br/></font>
<font face = "Courier" size = "3" color = "#65eb34">
Music doesn't matter. You don't have to play another note of music. This is, perhaps, what gives music its meaning; its soul, its life. I am doing this because I want to, and only because I want to. This is a point worth meditating on. Without needing to play music, you are free. Playing music without the need to play music makes it an exercise in love.<br/><br/>
But we <i>need</i> our loved ones, don't we? Without them, how could we possibly live? And yet we apparently argue that <i>needing</i> to do something reduces the action of the domain of love. We argue that we could so do without music, it is so useless to us that we can approach it with open arms; away from any semblance of dependence. Is this not irresponsible parenting at worst? When applied to your children, perhaps so. Maybe because we have a morally mandated responsibility to care for them. But music is not like that. Music would get on just fine without you! The will be scores of visionaries in each generation, at least before the apocalypse strikes. You will not be missed. And yet this is the thing you choose to kindle, even if you may lose it any day? If one day it vanishes, will it have all been for nought? <br/><br/>Well, not if you have allowed it to fully influence your self in a positive way. Not if it was used as a vehicle to build upon the self. Now that can't be taken away... can it? Oh, don't get me started on food.
